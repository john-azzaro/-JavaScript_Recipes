## What is JavaScript Recipes?
<dl>
<dd>

**JavaScript Recipes** is a collection of JavaScript outlines, studies, models, prototypes, reference documents, cheat sheets, etc. in one convenient place! 

Why do I call these documents "recipes"? A *recipe* is defined as a set of instructions for making something. When you make a cake, you follow a recipe to get the right ingredients, the cooking time, etc. Same thing applies to programming! Each folder contains *recipes* examine a particular part of JavaScript, such as outlines of particular subjects in JavaScript like functions in *JavaScript Outlines*. Each and every document examines one subject (i.e. functions, arrays, fibonacci series solutions, concatentation methods, etc.) in either a step-by-step process with multiple solutions or Question-and-Answer formats. Hope you find these recipes
