/*
1. What is a program?
////////////////////
    - a program is a set of instructions a computer carries out.
    - the skill of a programmer is finding a solution to a problem and implementing those solutions with a programming language
      so the computer can execute it.

/*
2. What is JavaScript?
/////////////////////
    - JavaScript is the only lnaguage that can be used on all modern browsers.
    - JavaScript is specified by ECMA and W3C specs.
    - JavaScript relies on individual browsers to handle how to implement ECMA and W3C specifications. 
    - JavaScript is used in two ways:
        -- First, modeling and manipulating data and proceses.
        -- Second, interacting with browser elements.

What is the history of JavaScript?
/////////////////////////////////
    - when JavaScript first became a thing, resources seemed to be very limited (take JS code and alter).
    - Initially, JavaScript was not properly standardized and browsers were problematic (IE, netscape) and all of them had different
      ways of dealing with the langauge.
    - when the web standardization movement came around (and html5 became accepted), browsers became standards-based and JavaScript 
      language development did not need to chase after the browser standards. 
    - jQuery initially became a way to level the playing field, but now browsers are good and standards have improved so much to
      the point where that you may not even need to use jQuery because you are adding extra code for an enviroment that doesnt exist
      anymore.
