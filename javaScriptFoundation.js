1. What is a program?
////////////////////
    - a program is a set of instructions a computer carries out.
    - the skill of a programmer is finding a solution to a problem and implementing those solutions with a programming language
      so the computer can execute it.
    - programming is like learning a language, where you need to learn new words, punctuation, and putting all these things 
      together to successfully communicate.
    - programming languages, like JavaScript, have thier own keywords an characters, as well as rules for putting them all together.
    - this is called the 'syntax' of the programming language.
    - a computer program (i.e. scripts) would be as simple as added a bit of javascript to your webpage.
    - programs work by manipulating values, like numbers or text.
    - a program retains a values in a variable, which is and allows that value to be refered to by name.

2. What is JavaScript?
/////////////////////
    - JavaScript is the only lnaguage that can be used on all modern browsers.
    - Javascript is a client-side langauge, meaning that it works inside a web browser.
        -- conversely, a server-side language would be node.js.
    - JavaScript is specified by ECMA and W3C specs.
    - JavaScript relies on individual browsers to handle how to implement ECMA and W3C specifications. 
    - JavaScript is used in two ways:
        -- First, modeling and manipulating data and proceses.
        -- Second, interacting with browser elements.
    - the JavaScript interpreter performs automatic 'garbage colleciton' for memory management, meaning the program can create objects
      and the programmer does not need to worry about destruction or deallocation of those objects.  
        -- when the program has no way to refer to it (no longer reachable), the interpreter automatically reclaims the memory it occuiped.

/*
What is the history of JavaScript?
/////////////////////////////////
    - when JavaScript first became a thing, resources seemed to be very limited (take JS code and alter).
    - Initially, JavaScript was not properly standardized and browsers were problematic (IE, netscape) and all of them had different
      ways of dealing with the langauge.
    - when the web standardization movement came around (and html5 became accepted), browsers became standards-based and JavaScript 
      language development did not need to chase after the browser standards. 
    - jQuery initially became a way to level the playing field, but now browsers are good and standards have improved so much to
      the point where that you may not even need to use jQuery because you are adding extra code for an enviroment that doesnt exist
      anymore.

Problem solving
////////////////
    -- Problem solving is hard because learning programming syntax uses a different "mental muscle" or "mental hemesphere" than problem solving.
      -- LEFT BRAIN activity involves programming syntax, readign programs, memorizing elements of an API which are analytical in nature.
      -- RIGHT BRAIN activity involves using those left-brain analytical skills and applying them with right-brain creativity.
    -- Problem solving is a CREATIVE activity
      -- For example, problem solving would be like figuring out how to get something on a high shelf without a ladder.
    -- Problem solving is the systemac approach to OVERCOMING an issue rather than AVOIDING it.
  
  What is problem solving?
  =======================
    -- Problem solving is writing an orginal program that perfoms a particualr set of tasks and meets all stated constraints.

  What are constraints?
  ====================
    -- Constraints include:
      -- programming language.
      -- performance.
      -- memory footprint.


  Problem Solving Methdologies
  ============================
    -- First, list the constraints of your problem.
      -- e.g. Farmer can only take one item in the boat at one time.

    -- Second, list the order of operations.
      -- e.g. Carry the fox to the far side of the river.
      -- e.g. Carry the hen to the far side of the river.
      -- e.g. Carry the grain to the far side of the river.
      
    -- Third, make those operations generic, or parameterized 
      -- e.g. Row boat from the far side of the river.
              IF boat is empty, load item on boat.
              IF boat is NOT empty, unload item on shore.

// useful problem solving strategies

// 1. Always have a plan
// 2. Restate the problem
// 3. Divide the Problem
// 5. Start with what you know
// 6. Reduce the Problem
// 7. Look for Analogies
// 8. Experiment
// 9. Dont get frustrated
// 10.

/*
Balance of active vs passive(conceptual) learning strategies
  -- spend good time on conceptual learning, but never neglect practical application by coding
Applying spacing to learning
  -- use effective memorization techniques or space the top out over a few days.
  -- avoid cramming
teaching the concepts you learn
  -- when you formulate an idea, you learn so much more.
  -- you find grey areas while teaching
keep track of questions
  -- keeping track of your "why's".
  -- if you dont track what you dont know, you have gaps that can be frustrating.
pace yourself so you can recover
